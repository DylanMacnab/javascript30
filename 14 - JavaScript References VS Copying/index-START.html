    // start with strings, numbers and booleans
    let age = 100;
    let age2 = age;
    console.log(age, age2); // 100 and 100
    age = 200;
    console.log(age, age2); // 200 and 100


    // Let's say we have an array
    const players = ['Wes', 'Sarah', 'Ryan', 'Poppy'];
    // and we want to make a copy of it.
    const team = players;
    // You might think we can just do something like this:
    console.log(players, team); // both the same array
    // however what happens when we update that array?
    team[3] = 'lux';
    // now here is the problem!
    console.log(players, team); // both arrays are updated because it changed the reference, not the copy.
    // oh no - we have edited the original array too!
    // Why? It's because that is an array reference, not an array copy. They both point to the same array!

    // So, how do we fix this? We take a copy instead!
    // one way
    const team2 = players.slice();
    // or create a new array and concat the old one in
    const team3 = [].concat(players);
    // or use the new ES6 Spread
    const team4 = [...players];
    // now when we update it, the original one isn't changed
    team2[3] = "Dylan";
    console.log(team2, players);

    // The same thing goes for objects, let's say we have a person object

    // with Objects
    const person = {
      name: "dylan macnab",
      age: 30
    }
    // and think we make a copy:
    const father = person;
    father.age = 99;
    console.log(person, father); // updates the reference person object as well :(
    // how do we take a copy instead?
    const mother = Object.assign({}, person);
    mother.age = 45;
    console.log(person, father, mother);
    // We will hopefully soon see the object ...spread

    // Things to note - this is only 1 level deep - both for Arrays and Objects. lodash has a cloneDeep method, but you should think twice before using it.

    /*
      WHAT I LEARNED:
      1. referencing a string, number, and boolean creates a new copy
      2. referencing an array does not create a copy
      3. var array2 = array1.slice() creates a copy of an array
      4. use Object.assign({}, object1); to copy an object
      5. It's hard to copy an array or object that is more than one level deep
      6. There's a lodash function for deep cloning but very rarely do you need to clone an array or object more than one level deep.
      7. There's also the "poor mans deep clone" using JSON parse and stringify... not recommended.
      8. A reference is not the same thing as a copy.
      9. Arrays and Objects create references. Numbers, objects, and booleans create copies.
